received it that was cool I guess he likes it the system works yeah it's good we actually have some we actually had some new merge pictures oh okay I'm uh I was the photographer for them so I'm just gonna go ahead I'm gonna pull this up and she's it this is that okay so this is a teaser for an upcoming video I don't want to say too much because I don't know what's public yeah very little is public actually this is gonna be a pretty fantastic video so I'm just gonna pull this up so basically Brandon gets pretty triggered every time someone messages him on Twitter and is like I want to be a great photographer what camera should I buy and he's like alright so it's hard to give you the right answer when you're asking the wrong question because becoming a photographer is about developing a style learning the fundamentals you know understanding the correct way to take a photo so that you can push the boundaries and experiment with the art form note that I didn't say anything about your camera okay another way to trigger Brandon show them one of those key notes for a cell phone launch where they say take DSLR like phone with your phone yeah he'll be like no that's just actually not how that works so on the one hand Brandon gets triggered if you ask him which camera to buy to make you better photographer but on the other hand he gets triggered if you tell them that a phone is just as good as a real camera so this is great Brandon actually came up with the idea and we got in a camera that he was really excited to play around with 51 megapixels is it 51 point 4 megapixels so this is the Fujifilm GFX 50 are so crazy camera like crazy camera to the point where I'm sure people out there would think wow with a camera like that in my hands I could be a photographer no problem and so what what he came up with was we weren't really sure how to like make a video about a product like that because it's a medium format camera which is really designed for a certain type of work like it's it's a tool designed for a certain type of job you'd say high fashion photography you know anything that you were to photograph that you would expect to print the size of you know the site of a building you would capture with a camera like that like the level of detail that it can capture is incredible and I kind of forget where I'm going with this very roundly story but long story short Brad and I were talking and he kind of pitches me this crazy idea and he goes how about this we do a photography challenge but we take an inexperienced photographer and I am at best an inexperienced photographer I think that's generous we take an inexperienced photographer we arm them with the GFX 50 R and then we put them up against an experienced photographer with a smartphone and we resolve once and for all does a smartphone hold up against the real camera and once and for all does an amazing camera turn you into a photographer if you're just some random scrub I love part of this concept because you're basically making him fight against himself because if he does too good of a job so Brandon with a pixel three versus me with a Fujifilm GFX fifty are now I'm not going to share a ton of this with you but I just want to show you guys one of my photos some of them are just far too spoilery but beyond the store at some point okay I mean it's wonderful oh it's not it was just loading yeah yeah okay I mean the highlights are a little a little blown out on that one yep his face is like actually just pure white yep yeah I mean it is coltan it's probably pretty close so in fairness to me yeah like you shine a light at coltan the guy's pretty white does he have a bottom Sun at all no he doesn't have pants on my understanding is that he was wearing underwear okay but it's possible he wasn't I have no way of verifying that he was in fact wearing underwear okay anyway guys look forward to this video if nothing else it's gonna be a ton of fun if nothing else seeing Colton with no pants on ten out of ten and there's this there's fun there's there's far worse no I'm sorry guys I really can't show this to you guys because it's gonna be such a moment in the video but make sure you don't miss the photography challenge I'm actually very proud of this photo you guys need to put that on a wall so just cuz it's so awkward it's pretty out there so you've seen that

carrying pointless items around in your pocket like receipts old hotel room keys or spent gift I wonder how many of those things I legitimately have in my wallet right now like a week ago I pitched a old hotel room receipt you know what I was actually pretty sure I had an old hotel room key I must have gotten rid of it because I accidentally kept one from my last try my mine was legit like last week or something I don't have any spent gift cards I actually keep mine Wow like actually keep pretty clean these days do you want to play what do you have in your wallet spend gift card nice yeah so I've receipts in Spain gift card I don't have old hotel room because I got rid of it last week okay I would have been three for three though so I've got my my health insurance benefits card yeah I've got my BCAA membership this one expired I don't think it actually matters I don't think your number changes I've got my driver's license I've got my Costco card okay so far we're exactly tired executive member nice thing of beauty I've got my access card for for work yep for one so far okay now I lose two three three debit cards those are all debit those are all debit yeah oh so the reason is that I've got my my joint account with the wife ooh okay I've got my my work debit card and then I've also got my just in case we ever get divorced I still need to have a bank account never cut no I'm just kidding I've just been a customer at TD since I was like six and I think having a very very long standing account can have advantages if you ever go to negotiate with them unlike something it's a free account so it cost me nothing to have it I just have to have a balance of like greater than ten dollars or something like that so I just hold on to it just in case like the other thing too is because Yvonne handles all of our money it's really hard for me to do simple things like buy her a birthday present without right because she'd see it's showing up on the credit card and yeah and so like I've had to resort to stupid things like hey hon don't look at the credit card statement for a bit and don't log into Amazon and she's like I'm actually your accountant I actually need to do okay so uh you're gonna see the line item before you see the item itself yeah so I so I have three debit cards and then I have four credit cards I have well personal and business Canadian cards and then personal and business USD cards yeah you've got me there I also have some cash retro I have some cash you got some cash vielen rat chow yep and then I did I had one receipt so I actually I actually run a fairly tight ship but I do think I need to get change no no change so my system for change is actually pretty straightforward I downgraded to a smaller wallet so I actually fully support the smaller wallet assuming you don't have too many cards for it I actually downgraded to a smaller wallet a number of you well you can see how many years ago it was I really need probably you've pretty much had that wallet the whole time I've known you I think oh definitely yeah oh yeah for sure yeah so so I downgraded because I had resolved to not carry around change or too many receipts anymore okay and so I devised a new system for change so the only thing I really use change for is to pay an exact change for a Monday night badminton okay and for like hot lunch day for my son school and like stuff like that like when I need to send money to school sure so I do need change but I don't need it on me sorry okay change goes along with my screwdriver in my back right pocket okay and then deposited every night at the end of the day I put it in my change bucket okay and then anytime I need change I get it from there so I never actually spend change I only a choir change and then when I specifically need it so we did a staycation because one of the things that one of my daughter's asked to do on our vacation was to ride the bus and I was like well that's a cheap date cool so we needed to go ride the bus as a family I had somewhere to go for change because you can't not have any change mm-hmm that's inconvenient I when I travel I like to have some cash on me and deal with cash sometimes just because everyone smile your cards will freak out and I like to just have some amount of local cash and then I also really like collecting relatively small denominations but still have a little bit of the change and a little bit of the cash from different countries that I go to just because I find it really interesting how they keep their stuff so then I often have like some weird mix of change from multiple different countries in the pocket until I deposit at home which I constantly forget to do but yeah this is actually pretty sick actually a number of people internally a switch to we should probably do the actual talking points here that would program helps you carry less it uses two metal RFID blocking plates that are bound by a strong elastic band that keeps your cards tightly together but still accessible you just pop them out like that and then they just kind of look like in like that looks and feels slick comes in different materials like aluminum carbon fiber and titanium and makes a great gift for Father's Day which is June 16th by the way guys more importantly Mother's Day this Sunday don't forget PSA PSA Mother's Day this Sunday at least send her a text message all right bare minimum and and learn this the hard way your wife of your children your mother of your to also a mother make sure you acknowledge her too don't miss that one that was that there was this one Mother's Day when like are you setting a reminder for yourself and I'm sending a tweet generally I do tweet reminders for everybody to try to help I know maybe our community isn't the greatest at remembering these types of things remember the like experience with non-techies thing our community is not necessarily great at certain other stuff so I try to help other people because I have problems remembering these things as well so when I get reminded I tweet it out and help other people are funny and then them responding to the tweet constantly reminds me that it's coming so it's actually helpful for me as well I try not to generalize but the thing is like within the techie community community I would say that consideration for things like special occasions is generally on the low end yeah with a general population the likelihood of a data let's say in a company okay in a company of mostly techie people like this one versus a company of like my wife's old job as a pharmacist so a pharmacy where it's predominantly female with technology the likelihood of someone showing up at our office with cupcakes to celebrate someone's birthday or like or a handcrafted gift to celebrate someone having a baby that everyone signs and like hand delivers to them much less likely here much more likely there I'm not gonna I'm not to generalize I'm just saying guys I'm horrible with this stuff I'm absolutely terrible about it it's always been kind of helpful for me because I am terrible about it and traditionally my boss man doesn't give two craps at all yeah forget my birthday 365 times a year my birthday even though time's it I do remember usually just like okay cool see it and the great thing is you'll usually be right yeah I get it yeah like a very high percentage of the time yeah higher than 99 you saw it it'll have more uptime than floatplane whoa footprints actually had pretty good actually it's not very good I was just thinking about my head I was like wait maybe not next Yeah right oh right wow it's taking us a while before our sponsors yeah sorry about that I also brought to you but well I don't know we ended up talking about other things that's also brought to you by honey so when you buy something online and find out later you could have got it for less that sucks unfortunately online coupon codes can be a total pain in the arse like honestly who hasn't done this Google like cuz you'll you'll be in the checkout and there it is it's tantalizing the coupon code field or the voucher field someone's probably got one of those someone probably has gonna have that too so you google it come at me and you come up with like all these results and there's all these even like large websites that are dedicated to compiling all of these coupon codes and you enter the ball in and none of them forget work so honey does all of that for it's a free browser extension that saves you money when you shop online honey scans the internet for coupon codes and other discounts then like magic it automatically applies them to your cart at checkout it knows a lot of coupon codes sale or discount codes at over 37,000 sites like Amazon Newegg Best Buy Gamestop Walmart eBay and more it takes just two clicks to install so head over to honeycomb forward slash Linus and install honey for free today well it's people in the office use it including me it's pretty sweet also brought to you by madrenas coffee oh man so uh madrenas they sponsored the roast yes as you know yep and we had a bit of a snafu with the the youtube version of the roast which by the way ladies and gentlemen will be going live on which one is it oh wow tomorrow I was just gonna say Leeds tomorrow oh so be going live on Saturday tomorrow at around noon we had a bit of a snafu with it today where we uploaded it and we didn't make it public but we accidentally added it to a playlist so a handful of people happened across it and I think this is going to be a fairly polarizing piece of content yeah not everyone is gonna like it hopefully you don't judge me or madrenas based on the things that are said by some of the people in the roast which i think might have been happening but just remember guys as you're watching it it was all in good fun and we're still friends and it's all good people we're more people worried about us so they wrote a lot of comments but the like/dislike ratio was one to two whoa okay how many people saw it though not many it only had about 50 views okay but it had eight dislikes yeah that's that's kind of weird pretty strong yeah the weird thing is almost everyone absolutely loved it on Flo plain yeah who where we'll find kind of our super I think super supporters I think you're gonna get more people there that understand because they know the people that are on stage more more likely because you're you're cutting out I know there's definitely gonna be people that watch on YouTube that just like yeah either don't want to or don't have the cash to watch on flow plane that are super hardcore fans that's totally cool yeah but you're also gonna have a higher percentage of people that aren't yeah and if you're not very familiar with everyone on stage and how friendly those people actually are some of those interactions might come across a little weird I'm not sure I don't know yeah I honestly like watch I've watched the entire thing through about four times now and it was entertaining every single time I think it's a fantastic piece of content I think the only thing that makes me sad about it yes the the audio tracks yeah the audience audio is not ideal yeah and I'm I come through everything yeah my laugh gets through everybody's mic so we didn't actually have for whatever reason the production company that helped us with it did not provide the multi-channel audio for the evening so we couldn't just turn you down when you weren't talking oh we only got a single audio track so with everything mixed that makes more sense I was like why I know my laugh is ridiculous but now this is a little mess so what I would recommend in order to have the best experience with it is to turn the volume up higher than you normally would Luke's gonna be super loud but you'll be able to hear the audience reacting to the jokes which adds a lot it's gonna add a lot because the the biggest problem is like something will be funny and the the presenter person will pause for laughter and you just like stare at them sitting there it's like okay it's really regrettable that we didn't have a we we were considering putting in a laugh track but we ended up opting to leave it o natural for better or worse yeah because the thing about a laugh track is there's so many different laughter reactions Oh like it's just it's so varied that weren't we weren't gonna be able to make it good so I would rather just leave it natural and then at least people can have you know nerf or worse I've lost showed a couple of times too though I I do find it quite funny but I can also yeah I don't know I can understand why some people it might not be their cup of tea I don't know some of the dislikes might have also been like hey this isn't what this playlist supposed no we've accidentally put stuff in playlists before that it's not really alright okay should we show a short like teaser sure is that a good idea sure okay it's going live anyways yeah yeah okay let's let's do it let's do a short teaser for anyone who hasn't seen it yet you just show it on floatplane so here you go ladies and gentlemen oh do they have this might show the URL right oh the unlisted URL what what a tremendous thought that I didn't think of hooray um Oh actually there's a floatplane exclusive I don't know if you saw this this one up dude that's cool the red all the red carpet interviews director's cut and I believe by director's cut we mean completely not cut no I don't think I can show the floatplane one all right yes I can answer this one okay all right so I'm gonna turn on audio I don't know how well that's gonna work but I mean we do have a warning on it in fairness to us man I love this intro wait for it wait for it wait for it after I think master yeah last day it's spelled right yeah I know we fixed that for the YouTube release just minor things and that weird interlacing issue we fixed that too I look so ridiculous in my my like grand theft auto intro screen thing yeah that stage was so cool I know it ended up looking so great in James's grandiose intro someone with a Chinese username says what's funny is people think they actually read this chat occasionally we do I don't know if they can actually hear this or no audio I haven't okay yeah that's no it's it's fine it's fine anyway it looks really good and yeah we're gonna have to figure out if we can get audio so thankfully check yeah thanks thanks guys oh man I hope people like it do we have any other main topics today or did it take us that oh wait I never did the madrenas talking points okay so good luck madrenas hopefully everyone doesn't hate you and us yeah you know if you guys liked the roast then you know please help keep madrenas afloat by ordering their coffee for fuel their organic cold brew coffee and convenient 16-ounce cans sixty knows they're 15 ounces them and they're rounding up they're like well everyone

about the exclusive exclusive out in a limited edition because we're we we actually can't get enough shirts to print as many of these as we want but the limited edition ltte Roast commemorative t-shirt have you seen this have you got this check it out so oh yes y'all have seen that that's legit it's the this is fine meme sort of inspired we only have I think about 600 of them or something like that that's like all that we could get in this shirt color and I really really wanted the red one for this so I am not expecting these to last past about the first hour or two yeah now to be clear we don't normally sell that kind of volume of shirts but we also don't normally do limited edition shirts and when we do they tend to sell really well it's just it's kind of thing we try not to overdo like that Tech linked shirt with the tape I forget how many units of that we move but it was like so funny because the inspiration for it really was just like yeah I actually just like we didn't intend to make it a shirt yeah until we were it was like already created anyway well the designs done so by the way while you're at it if you want to grab the water bottle we have more shipments coming in three to four weeks I believe so there ""

Shave Club is it's a service they they send you men's grooming products through the post and you get little parcels now I must admit that I have not been using a service like this possibly you can tell but I can say that my whole life I have used a not wildly dissimilar service which is that being British I am able to have milk fresh milk delivered to my door every day and do you know it's really nice you open the door and yeah there's your morning painter I guess someone's thinking of it now okay I know my true relationship with with my milkman which is not genetic it's a financial business relationship I understand that but even so it's nice someone has done that for me and I don't have to go out to the supermarket anything like as often as I otherwise would because milk is something you have to buy frequently and it's perishable and so forth so getting milk deliver this is nice and we like receiving stuff in the pinup in the poster now obviously if you don't like receiving parcels then a service like this is probably not for you but don't we like oh someone sent me a box of stuff and I'm not into the shorts in there it's a bit like opening a Christmas present or something there's a there's a little bit of excitement there so that's one of the reasons that you might want to use one of these services but the more perceptive of you and I would say the less perceptive of you and I would extend this to to those of middling perceptive abilities may all have drawn the same conclusion which is that I am not an obvious ambassador for a company that sells men's grooming products and I intimated this to them and they they persuaded me they said no you see you're a victim and that's what we need you're you're someone that life has just crushed and we could use you you you serve as a as a warning to the rest of humanity to the possibility of what you may end up like if you don't use our products and you serve as a sort of universal before picture doesn't matter what male grooming product we're trying to sell with you as the before picture you will serve I did actually see their point anyway so they've sent me a box and I'm contractually obliged to open it with you I've already slit the plastic bit so it comes open that's get rid of that and yes yes that's the smell I was expecting and I see I see a toothbrush which appears to be like a toothbrush and we need two brushes otherwise our teeth not always a clean and ah no this is ah yes they have favoured me cuz this this is no ordinary handle for a razor no no this I I see straightaway is the executive handle I'm not entirely sure what that means it doesn't have a smart suit on it's not carrying a briefcase and it's probably not going to give it give anyone in the orders but but it's an executive one which is got a bit of heft to it and some grippy rubber and yes and this must be yes these are the blades and this is called a cassette apparently you you get four months of them here oh and my goodness how many blades are we up to do you think it's actually so many they're difficult to count it's it's six we're up to six blades now so there you go for those of you who have used a smaller number of blades you may have found that sometimes your primary blade doesn't do the job in a bit of hair gets passed but then maybe your secondary blade gets it but sometimes it doesn't so then your tertiary blade comes into play but you know even the tertiary blades sometimes let you down so then of course on on other lesser razerheadz you've got your special contingency blade which comes into action but there's still not about 100 percent guaranteed to do the job so then comes the emergency backup blade well ladies and gentlemen I suppose mostly gentlemen although actually I'm told that only four million customers that Dollar Shave Club has had about twenty percent of them are women yes now if your first second third fourth and fifth blades all let you down the last resort blade on this will do the job probably what I don't know what the limits are I mean it's certain there are mostly limits of physics and engineering to the number of blades that they're actually practicable on ahead we're up to six now it seems maybe in years to come that people have just sort of a rack like a washboard do you some rub your face on it or something I don't know anyway seven tubes of stuff I have a tube of hydrating daily face cleanser which is citrus and Hawaiian ginger now hydrating is good of course because some people have a lot of trouble drinking water and so the only way they can get water into them is to rub it through their skin daily face cleanser I know what cleanser is that just means cleaner but it sounds better and date I don't actually have a daily face which is quite evident mine is weekly or even more of a monthly face but if you've got a daily face and it needs cleansing or cleaning presumably that'll do and an Hawaiian ginger is like ordinary ginger but with more vowels citrus doesn't say what sort of citrus mystery citrus oh nope it's great for chocolates my favorite and this one is okay I've read it three times now and I disappearing post-shave do our words that I've never seen in that order before disappearing it evaporates do that's that's water right post shape I understand what post shave is anyway it says for a light and soothing finish a lot well there you go so if you if you are someone who's in the habit of shaving and I imagine that most of my audience does not have beards then you may find that sometimes your your shave finish is too dark or too heavy in which case this will perhaps help here we have easy shave butter I'm a beginner to this sort of thing so I think it's appropriate they sent me the easy version I imagine that others of you will be able to order more advanced shave butter butter I've known again shave butter but anyway for us it's a for effortless delightful shaving delightful they go for some people I'm sure shaving is a hobby no delight so um that'll be good and I have the super bra no I have misread that it's super BA and oh it's toothpaste you know let's put the Handy size actually fit for travel in your Airport and so forth and it says peppermint kick so there you go superb ah for people with teeth that need a kick and here we have hydrating again which is which is good don't don't overdose on water kids hair and scalp shampoo which is sage and black pepper sage of black pepper as Moses huh I spot a masculine scent isn't it and I suppose in an emergency he could double his a cooking ingredient hair and scalp shampoo and is that is that different from normal shampoo have I been doing it wrong all these years is there such a thing as just scalp shampoo how do you use that without getting it on your hair that's be really tricky well just hair shampoo so you don't go all the way down to the scalp because then something will go horribly wrong I don't know but this one does hair and thank goodness scalp and then there's this which is a mandatory prep scrub so there you go this one's not optional it's it's mandatory and properly prepare for shave greatness it says okay I'll do that and here we have more hydrating my goodness I'm gonna be so hydrated it's coming just flowing out of me body cleanser which is calming amber and lavender calming amber calming amber is amber even a smell does amber smell or some other thing and while Brazil II there's they have quite a wide range of products presumably if you want their panic-inducing amber you can get that too so there you go now if you go to www.hsn.com or US dollars if you're American and some near equivalent if you're from one of the other countries that they serve which is Australia Britain and Canada but no British forces supposed to overseas yet I'm afraid sorry chaps but they're working on it anyway so you can there's an offer and yes in in time I will
