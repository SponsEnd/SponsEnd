       "'Have you ever tried petting a cat, but every\\xa0\\ntime you come closer, the cat runs away and\\xa0\\xa0keeps watching you from a distance? Then,\\xa0\\nyou walk towards the cat in a second attempt,\\xa0\\xa0but it runs away again. When you approach the cat\\xa0\\na third time, it flees and disappears. However,\\xa0\\xa0a few hours later, when you’ve focused your\\xa0\\nattention on something else, the cat appears,\\xa0\\xa0walks toward you, and jumps onto your lap.\\nA phenomenon we often experience is that when\\xa0\\xa0we chase something or someone, it moves away from\\xa0\\nus. But when we leave it alone, it comes to us.\\xa0\\xa0This mechanism can be hard to reconcile with the\\xa0\\nidea that ‘effort’ is the key to success. Even\\xa0\\xa0though it’s true that achieving goals often\\xa0\\nrequires work, there’s also another side to\\xa0\\xa0the story. The law of reversed effort shows us\\xa0\\nthat, in many situations, putting in work only\\xa0\\xa0removes us further from the desired outcome.\\xa0\\nAnd that the more we try, the worse it gets.\\xa0\\xa0But the less we try, the better it gets. Hence,\\xa0\\nachieving goals doesn’t just require work; we also\\xa0\\xa0must abstain from action. And to know when to act\\xa0\\nand when not to, we need intelligence and skill.\\xa0In a previous video, we explored a dimension\\xa0\\nof the law of reversed effort (also called ‘the\\xa0\\xa0backwards law’). But this exploration was\\xa0\\nfrom the viewpoint of pursuing happiness,\\xa0\\xa0as stated by bestselling author Mark\\xa0\\nManson: “wanting a positive experience\\xa0\\xa0is a negative experience; accepting a\\xa0\\nnegative experience is a positive experience.”\\xa0\\xa0End quote. So, the more we want happiness, the\\xa0\\nless happy we’ll be, as we’re reinforcing a\\xa0\\xa0sense of lack. And that if we’re content with\\xa0\\nhow things are (and not in a state of lack),\\xa0\\xa0we suddenly have what we’re looking for. But in\\xa0\\nthis video, we’ll explore the law of reversed\\xa0\\xa0effort from the viewpoint of performance,\\xa0\\nachieving goals, and overcoming fears.The law of reversed effort was once coined by\\xa0\\nEnglish writer and philosopher Aldous Huxley,\\xa0\\xa0who stated that we only achieve proficiency by\\xa0\\ncombining relaxation with activity. I quote:The harder we try with the conscious will to do\\xa0\\nsomething, the less we shall succeed. Proficiency\\xa0\\xa0and the results of proficiency come only to\\xa0\\nthose who have learned the paradoxical art of\\xa0\\xa0doing and not doing, or combining relaxation with\\xa0\\nactivity, of letting go as a person in order that\\xa0\\xa0the immanent and transcendent unknown quantity may\\xa0\\ntake hold. We cannot make ourselves understand;\\xa0\\xa0the most we can do is to foster a state of\\xa0\\nmind, in which understanding may come to us.Imagine an insomniac trying to sleep. The\\xa0\\nmore he tries, the longer he seems to stay\\xa0\\xa0awake. And the longer he stays awake, the more\\xa0\\nfrustrated he becomes and the harder he tries.\\xa0\\xa0But after a while, the insomniac stops trying,\\xa0\\xa0accepting that he can’t sleep. And\\xa0\\nsuddenly, without any effort, he dozes off.\\xa0Sleep is one of those many things we cannot\\xa0\\nforce. Yet, we often try hard to fall asleep,\\xa0\\xa0with horrible results. When we look at the nature\\xa0\\nof sleep, this isn’t much of a surprise. We can\\xa0\\xa0see sleep as the ultimate form of relaxation.\\xa0\\nThus, trying to sleep is pretty contradicting,\\xa0\\xa0as we make an effort (or even force ourselves)\\xa0\\nto relax, which is the opposite of relaxation.\\xa0Another thing we cannot force is attraction.\\xa0\\nNo one chooses to be attracted to someone or\\xa0\\xa0something; it just happens. Even\\xa0\\nthough this is a generalization,\\xa0\\xa0by and large, we see that clinginess repels, and\\xa0\\nelusiveness attracts. The more we chase someone,\\xa0\\xa0the less attractive we become. But if\\xa0\\nwe stop chasing, we become more elusive,\\xa0\\xa0and the attraction may return. As the proverb\\xa0\\ngoes: “absence makes the heart grow fonder.”\\xa0Trying too hard often backfires. Philosopher\\xa0\\nand psychiatrist Viktor Frankl observed\\xa0\\xa0that when we focus too much on achieving\\xa0\\nspecific outcomes (and preventing others),\\xa0\\xa0we generate “anticipatory anxiety.” In many cases,\\xa0\\nthis hyper-intention leads to the situation we try\\xa0\\xa0to avoid. An example from his book Man’s Search\\xa0\\nFor Meaning is a stutterer who desperately tries\\xa0\\xa0not to stutter. But because he tries too\\xa0\\nhard, his speech falters even more as he’s\\xa0\\xa0anxious not to speak without stammering. And\\xa0\\nso, it’s with many things. If we try too hard\\xa0\\xa0to enjoy ourselves, we’re probably not enjoying\\xa0\\nourselves because we’re so fixated on results\\xa0\\xa0that the fixation itself is unpleasant.\\nAnother example is people who experience\\xa0\\xa0difficulties climaxing in the bedroom.\\xa0\\nThe more they fixate on trying to climax,\\xa0\\xa0the less successful they’ll be, and\\xa0\\nthe more dreadful the whole bedroom\\xa0\\xa0experience becomes (including the anticipation\\xa0\\nbeforehand). Again, hyper-fixation on specific\\xa0\\xa0outcomes hijacks one’s ability to perform.\\nViktor Frankl provides us with a practical\\xa0\\xa0method called ‘paradoxical intention.’ This method\\xa0\\ncan help us relieve ourselves of hyper-intention\\xa0\\xa0or, in other words: not try so hard. By applying\\xa0\\nparadoxical intention, we shift the paradigm from\\xa0\\xa0avoiding specific outcomes (like stuttering or not\\xa0\\nbeing able to sleep) to wanting these outcomes. By\\xa0\\xa0wishing for things we previously tried to prevent\\xa0\\nfrom happening, we’re less likely to become\\xa0\\xa0petrified by anxiety, as we remove the pressure\\xa0\\nof wanting results. So, we’re more likely to fall\\xa0\\xa0asleep by wishing to stay awake than by trying\\xa0\\nhard. You’ll find a more detailed exploration\\xa0\\xa0of paradoxical intention in a previous video\\xa0\\nnamed Viktor Frankl’s Method to Overcome Fear.Learning to drive a car can be an immensely\\xa0\\nfrustrating experience. It takes many lessons\\xa0\\xa0and many hours to master for most people.\\nFor an inexperienced person, controlling\\xa0\\xa0a vehicle (while watching traffic) is\\xa0\\na very unnatural and complicated task.\\xa0\\xa0Unless you drive an automatic, you have to step on\\xa0\\nthree different pedals to accelerate, slow down,\\xa0\\xa0and switch gears, and you must learn to use\\xa0\\nmirrors to observe what’s happening around\\xa0\\xa0the car. It seems almost impossible to master.\\xa0\\nHowever, after lots of practice, you suddenly\\xa0\\xa0catch yourself automatically doing these things.\\nOur conscious mind is a gift and a curse.\\xa0\\xa0It allows us to reason, analyze, and use\\xa0\\nlanguage. However, the conscious mind\\xa0\\xa0often sits in the way of what the Taoists call\\xa0\\n‘wu-wei,’ also referred to as the flow state.\\xa0\\xa0In the flow state, our actions are fluent and\\xa0\\neffortless, as if they happen by themselves:\\xa0\\xa0as if the dancer becomes the dance or the painter\\xa0\\nbecomes the painting. The video ‘Taoism | The\\xa0\\xa0Philosophy of Flow’ quotes retired basketball\\xa0\\nplayer Bill Russell, describing the flow state\\xa0\\xa0as “playing in slow motion” and that he “could\\xa0\\nalmost sense how the next play would develop\\xa0\\xa0and where the next shot would be taken.”\\nAny conscious effort in addition to the\\xa0\\xa0flow state causes us to hesitate. That’s\\xa0\\nwhy the moment we become consciously aware\\xa0\\xa0that we’re in such a state, and we begin\\xa0\\nintellectualizing and trying to control it;\\xa0\\xa0we lose it. And so, many of our actions seem\\xa0\\nto emerge from beyond our conscious minds.\\xa0The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung realized that our\\xa0\\nconscious mind is just a tiny part of the psyche.\\xa0\\xa0We could compare the conscious\\xa0\\nmind to the tip of an iceberg,\\xa0\\xa0while the unconscious is the major part\\xa0\\nof the iceberg that lies underwater,\\xa0\\xa0invisible to those above the\\xa0\\nsurface. Hence, according to Jung,\\xa0\\xa0the psyche generates many unconscious processes\\xa0\\nthat the conscious mind isn’t aware of. Similarly,\\xa0\\xa0Aldous Huxley distinguished between consciousness\\xa0\\nand the personal conscious, saying that a relaxed\\xa0\\xa0personal conscious is required to let\\xa0\\nthe “wider self” come through. I quote:The personal conscious self being a kind of\\xa0\\nsmall island in the midst of an enormous area\\xa0\\xa0of consciousness — what has to\\xa0\\nbe relaxed is the personal self,\\xa0\\xa0the self that tries too hard, that thinks it\\xa0\\nknows what is what, that uses language. This\\xa0\\xa0has to be relaxed in order that the multiple\\xa0\\npowers at work within the deeper and wider self\\xa0\\xa0may come through and function as they should.\\xa0\\nIn all psychophysical skills we have this\\xa0\\xa0curious fact of the law of reversed effort:\\xa0\\nthe harder we try, the worse we do the thing.End quote.When someone asked author Charles Bukowski\\xa0\\nhow he writes and creates, he answered:You don’t (...) You don’t try. That’s very\\xa0\\nimportant: not to try, either for Cadillacs,\\xa0\\xa0creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing\\xa0\\nhappens, you wait some more. It’s like a bug\\xa0\\xa0high on the wall. You wait for it to come to\\xa0\\nyou. When it gets close enough you reach out,\\xa0\\xa0slap out and kill it. Or if you like\\xa0\\nits looks, you make a pet out of it.End quote.The more we try, the worse it gets. The more we\\xa0\\nchase the people we desire, the more they run from\\xa0\\xa0us. The harder we try to sell something, the fewer\\xa0\\nsales we tend to make. But if we don’t act at all,\\xa0\\xa0we won’t see any results either. So, we’re looking\\xa0\\nfor a middle path between action and non-action,\\xa0\\xa0between conscious effort and letting action occur.\\nOn the one hand, conscious effort seems necessary\\xa0\\xa0to develop our skills: we need to practice, learn,\\xa0\\nthink, understand and analyze. On the other hand,\\xa0\\xa0the absence of conscious effort and\\xa0\\nintellectual activity seems necessary\\xa0\\xa0for letting the developed skills emerge\\xa0\\nnaturally. We have to calm the mind and\\xa0\\xa0“get out of our own way,” so to speak, to\\xa0\\nperform optimally. As Aldous Huxley wrote:Take the piano teacher, for example. He always\\xa0\\nsays, relax, relax. But how can you relax while\\xa0\\xa0your fingers are rushing over the keys? Yet\\xa0\\nthey have to relax. The singing teacher and\\xa0\\xa0the golf pro say exactly the same thing. And in\\xa0\\nthe realm of spiritual exercises, we find that\\xa0\\xa0the person who teaches mental prayer does too. We\\xa0\\nhave somehow to combine relaxation with activity.End quote.The flow state appears to accompany mental\\xa0\\nclarity and equanimity, according to the\\xa0\\xa0accounts of people who experienced it.
