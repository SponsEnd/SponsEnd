I can\'t think of an object that\'s been with me longer. I currently wear a second edition, which will eventually\nbecome the third most persistent object in my life. *rings hit each other* "What\'s the second most persistent?"

are restocked now so Peter bought one yes we have lots of them sick yeah I would have just given him I know I told him that okay yeah but he got one and he received it that was cool I guess he likes it the system works yeah it's good we actually have some we actually had some new merge pictures oh okay I'm uh I was the photographer for them so I'm just gonna go ahead I'm gonna pull this up and she's it this is that okay so this is a teaser for an upcoming video I don't want to say too much because I don't know what's public yeah very little is public actually this is gonna be a pretty fantastic video so I'm just gonna pull this up so basically Brandon gets pretty triggered every time someone messages him on Twitter and is like I want to be a great photographer what camera should I buy and he's like alright so it's hard to give you the right answer when you're asking the wrong question because becoming a photographer is about developing a style learning the fundamentals you know understanding the correct way to take a photo so that you can push the boundaries and experiment with the art form note that I didn't say anything about your camera okay another way to trigger Brandon show them one of those key notes for a cell phone launch where they say take DSLR like phone with your phone yeah he'll be like no that's just actually not how that works so on the one hand Brandon gets triggered if you ask him which camera to buy to make you better photographer but on the other hand he gets triggered if you tell them that a phone is just as good as a real camera so this is great Brandon actually came up with the idea and we got in a camera that he was really excited to play around with 51 megapixels is it 51 point 4 megapixels so this is the Fujifilm GFX 50 are so crazy camera like crazy camera to the point where I'm sure people out there would think wow with a camera like that in my hands I could be a photographer no problem and so what what he came up with was we weren't really sure how to like make a video about a product like that because it's a medium format camera which is really designed for a certain type of work like it's it's a tool designed for a certain type of job you'd say high fashion photography you know anything that you were to photograph that you would expect to print the size of you know the site of a building you would capture with a camera like that like the level of detail that it can capture is incredible and I kind of forget where I'm going with this very roundly story but long story short Brad and I were talking and he kind of pitches me this crazy idea and he goes how about this we do a photography challenge but we take an inexperienced photographer and I am at best an inexperienced photographer I think that's generous we take an inexperienced photographer we arm them with the GFX 50 R and then we put them up against an experienced photographer with a smartphone and we resolve once and for all does a smartphone hold up against the real camera and once and for all does an amazing camera turn you into a photographer if you're just some random scrub I love part of this concept because you're basically making him fight against himself because if he does too good of a job so Brandon with a pixel three versus me with a Fujifilm GFX fifty are now I'm not going to share a ton of this with you but I just want to show you guys one of my photos some of them are just far too spoilery but beyond the store at some point okay I mean it's wonderful oh it's not it was just loading yeah yeah okay I mean the highlights are a little a little blown out on that one yep his face is like actually just pure white yep yeah I mean it is coltan it's probably pretty close so in fairness to me yeah like you shine a light at coltan the guy's pretty white does he have a bottom Sun at all no he doesn't have pants on my understanding is that he was wearing underwear okay but it's possible he wasn't I have no way of verifying that he was in fact wearing underwear okay anyway guys look forward to this video if nothing else it's gonna be a ton of fun if nothing else seeing Colton with no pants on ten out of ten and there's this there's fun there's there's far worse no I'm sorry guys I really can't show this to you guys because it's gonna be such a moment in the video but make sure you don't miss the photography challenge I'm actually very proud of this photo you guys need to put that on a wall so just cuz it's so awkward it's pretty out there so you've seen that one yeah well yeah he's he's seen all of it he's seen all of it so guys I mean should I you know what I will give you I will give you one small spoiler it's really close like this does not end up being a blowout so no matter what you think no matter what preconceived notions you come into this video with you're right [Laughter] oh people are so bad in chat I'm so me not showing them though any of those pictures guys it's like actually come

264, 'there’s a high demand for qualified engineers. For anyone looking to build or advance their\nengineering career I’d highly recommend Brilliant. Brilliant recently introduced a new feature,\ncalled “Daily Problems”, which will present with you with interesting scientific and mathematical\nproblems to test your brain. Like this one, that teaches you about rolling\nresistance. One of the ways vehicles lose energy. It takes you through a short explanation of\nrolling resistance, giving you the framework you need to rationalise a question they pose\nto you. Here the answer is pretty simple. Rolling resistance occurs from the loss of\nenergy to the ground and wheels, so by driving from gravel to concrete we lose less energy\nto the ground. If you answer a question wrong though, you\ncan get help by discussing the solution with thousands of other users.. Allowing you to learn from your mistakes. Brilliant even have an app that you can download\nto play these brain teasers on your morning commute. If you like the problem and want to learn\nmore, there’s a course quiz that explores the same concept in greater detail. Daily problems are thought provoking challenges\nthat will lead you from curiosity to mastery one day at a time. So what are you waiting for? Go to brilliant.org/realengineering/ and finish\nyour day a little smarter. And the first 500 of you to do so will get\n20% off the annual subscription to view all problems in the archives. '

301, "you can go down the rabbit hole if you want we should probably do maybe a wild oh man that timing this wallet is technology it's technology yeah stop carrying pointless items around in your pocket like receipts old hotel room keys or spent gift I wonder how many of those things I legitimately have in my wallet right now like a week ago I pitched a old hotel room receipt you know what I was actually pretty sure I had an old hotel room key I must have gotten rid of it because I accidentally kept one from my last try my mine was legit like last week or something I don't have any spent gift cards I actually keep mine Wow like actually keep pretty clean these days do you want to play what do you have in your wallet spend gift card nice yeah so I've receipts in Spain gift card I don't have old hotel room because I got rid of it last week okay I would have been three for three though so I've got my my health insurance benefits card yeah I've got my BCAA membership this one expired I don't think it actually matters I don't think your number changes I've got my driver's license I've got my Costco card okay so far we're exactly tired executive member nice thing of beauty I've got my access card for for work yep for one so far okay now I lose two three three debit cards those are all debit those are all debit yeah oh so the reason is that I've got my my joint account with the wife ooh okay I've got my my work debit card and then I've also got my just in case we ever get divorced I still need to have a bank account never cut no I'm just kidding I've just been a customer at TD since I was like six and I think having a very very long standing account can have advantages if you ever go to negotiate with them unlike something it's a free account so it cost me nothing to have it I just have to have a balance of like greater than ten dollars or something like that so I just hold on to it just in case like the other thing too is because Yvonne handles all of our money it's really hard for me to do simple things like buy her a birthday present without right because she'd see it's showing up on the credit card and yeah and so like I've had to resort to stupid things like hey hon don't look at the credit card statement for a bit and don't log into Amazon and she's like I'm actually your accountant I actually need to do okay so uh you're gonna see the line item before you see the item itself yeah so I so I have three debit cards and then I have four credit cards I have well personal and business Canadian cards and then personal and business USD cards yeah you've got me there I also have some cash retro I have some cash you got some cash vielen rat chow yep and then I did I had one receipt so I actually I actually run a fairly tight ship but I do think I need to get change no no change so my system for change is actually pretty straightforward I downgraded to a smaller wallet so I actually fully support the smaller wallet assuming you don't have too many cards for it I actually downgraded to a smaller wallet a number of you well you can see how many years ago it was I really need probably you've pretty much had that wallet the whole time I've known you I think oh definitely yeah oh yeah for sure yeah so so I downgraded because I had resolved to not carry around change or too many receipts anymore okay and so I devised a new system for change so the only thing I really use change for is to pay an exact change for a Monday night badminton okay and for like hot lunch day for my son school and like stuff like that like when I need to send money to school sure so I do need change but I don't need it on me sorry okay change goes along with my screwdriver in my back right pocket okay and then deposited every night at the end of the day I put it in my change bucket okay and then anytime I need change I get it from there so I never actually spend change I only a choir change and then when I specifically need it so we did a staycation because one of the things that one of my daughter's asked to do on our vacation was to ride the bus and I was like well that's a cheap date cool so we needed to go ride the bus as a family I had somewhere to go for change because you can't not have any change mm-hmm that's inconvenient I when I travel I like to have some cash on me and deal with cash sometimes just because everyone smile your cards will freak out and I like to just have some amount of local cash and then I also really like collecting relatively small denominations but still have a little bit of the change and a little bit of the cash from different countries that I go to just because I find it really interesting how they keep their stuff so then I often have like some weird mix of change from multiple different countries in the pocket until I deposit at home which I constantly forget to do but yeah this is actually pretty sick actually a number of people internally a switch to we should probably do the actual talking points here that would program helps you carry less it uses two metal RFID blocking plates that are bound by a strong elastic band that keeps your cards tightly together but still accessible you just pop them out like that and then they just kind of look like in like that looks and feels slick comes in different materials like aluminum carbon fiber and titanium and makes a great gift for Father's Day which is June 16th by the way guys more importantly Mother's Day this Sunday don't forget PSA PSA Mother's Day this Sunday at least send her a text message all right bare minimum and and learn this the hard way your wife of your children your mother of your to also a mother make sure you acknowledge her too don't miss that one that was that there was this one Mother's Day when like are you setting a reminder for yourself and I'm sending a tweet generally I do tweet reminders for everybody to try to help I know maybe our community isn't the greatest at remembering these types of things remember the like experience with non-techies thing our community is not necessarily great at certain other stuff so I try to help other people because I have problems remembering these things as well so when I get reminded I tweet it out and help other people are funny and then them responding to the tweet constantly reminds me that it's coming so it's actually helpful for me as well I try not to generalize but the thing is like within the techie community community I would say that consideration for things like special occasions is generally on the low end yeah with a general population the likelihood of a data let's say in a company okay in a company of mostly techie people like this one versus a company of like my wife's old job as a pharmacist so a pharmacy where it's predominantly female with technology the likelihood of someone showing up at our office with cupcakes to celebrate someone's birthday or like or a handcrafted gift to celebrate someone having a baby that everyone signs and like hand delivers to them much less likely here much more likely there I'm not gonna I'm not to generalize I'm just saying guys I'm horrible with this stuff I'm absolutely terrible about it it's always been kind of helpful for me because I am terrible about it and traditionally my boss man doesn't give two craps at all yeah forget my birthday 365 times a year my birthday even though time's it I do remember usually just like okay cool see it and the great thing is you'll usually be right yeah I get it yeah like a very high percentage of the time yeah higher than 99 you saw it it'll have more uptime than floatplane whoa footprints actually had pretty good actually it's not very good I was just thinking about my head I was like wait maybe not next Yeah right oh right wow it's taking us a while before our sponsors yeah sorry about that I also brought to you but well I don't know we ended up talking about other things that's also brought to you by honey so when you buy something online and find out later you could have got it for less that sucks unfortunately online coupon codes can be a total pain in the arse like honestly who hasn't done this Google like cuz you'll you'll be in the checkout and there it is it's tantalizing the coupon code field or the voucher field someone's probably got one of those someone probably has gonna have that too so you google it come at me and you come up with like all these results and there's all these even like large websites that are dedicated to compiling all of these coupon codes and you enter the ball in and none of them forget work so honey does all of that for it's a free browser extension that saves you money when you shop online honey scans the internet for coupon codes and other discounts then like magic it

madrenas coffee oh man so uh madrenas they sponsored the roast yes as you know yep and we had a bit of a snafu with the the youtube version of the roast which by the way ladies and gentlemen will be going live on which one is it oh wow tomorrow I was just gonna say Leeds tomorrow oh so be going live on Saturday tomorrow at around noon we had a bit of a snafu with it today where we uploaded it and we didn't make it public but we accidentally added it to a playlist so a handful of people happened across it and I think this is going to be a fairly polarizing piece of content yeah not everyone is gonna like it hopefully you don't judge me or madrenas based on the things that are said by some of the people in the roast which i think might have been happening but just remember guys as you're watching it it was all in good fun and we're still friends and it's all good people we're more people worried about us so they wrote a lot of comments but the like/dislike ratio was one to two whoa okay how many people saw it though not many it only had about 50 views okay but it had eight dislikes yeah that's that's kind of weird pretty strong yeah the weird thing is almost everyone absolutely loved it on Flo plain yeah who where we'll find kind of our super I think super supporters I think you're gonna get more people there that understand because they know the people that are on stage more more likely because you're you're cutting out I know there's definitely gonna be people that watch on YouTube that just like yeah either don't want to or don't have the cash to watch on flow plane that are super hardcore fans that's totally cool yeah but you're also gonna have a higher percentage of people that aren't yeah and if you're not very familiar with everyone on stage and how friendly those people actually are some of those interactions might come across a little weird I'm not sure I don't know yeah I honestly like watch I've watched the entire thing through about four times now and it was entertaining every single time I think it's a fantastic piece of content I think the only thing that makes me sad about it yes the the audio tracks yeah the audience audio is not ideal yeah and I'm I come through everything yeah my laugh gets through everybody's mic so we didn't actually have for whatever reason the production company that helped us with it did not provide the multi-channel audio for the evening so we couldn't just turn you down when you weren't talking oh we only got a single audio track so with everything mixed that makes more sense I was like why I know my laugh is ridiculous but now this is a little mess so what I would recommend in order to have the best experience with it is to turn the volume up higher than you normally would Luke's gonna be super loud but you'll be able to hear the audience reacting to the jokes which adds a lot it's gonna add a lot because the the biggest problem is like something will be funny and the the presenter person will pause for laughter and you just like stare at them sitting there it's like okay it's really regrettable that we didn't have a we we were considering putting in a laugh track but we ended up opting to leave it o natural for better or worse yeah because the thing about a laugh track is there's so many different laughter reactions Oh like it's just it's so varied that weren't we weren't gonna be able to make it good so I would rather just leave it natural and then at least people can have you know nerf or worse I've lost showed a couple of times too though I I do find it quite funny but I can also yeah I don't know I can understand why some people it might not be their cup of tea I don't know some of the dislikes might have also been like hey this isn't what this playlist supposed no we've accidentally put stuff in playlists before that it's not really alright okay should we show a short like teaser sure is that a good idea sure okay it's going live anyways yeah yeah okay let's let's do it let's do a short teaser for anyone who hasn't seen it yet you just show it on floatplane so here you go ladies and gentlemen oh do they have this might show the URL right oh the unlisted URL what what a tremendous thought that I didn't think of hooray um Oh actually there's a floatplane exclusive I don't know if you saw this this one up dude that's cool the red all the red carpet interviews director's cut and I believe by director's cut we mean completely not cut no I don't think I can show the floatplane one all right yes I can answer this one okay all right so I'm gonna turn on audio I don't know how well that's gonna work but I mean we do have a warning on it in fairness to us man I love this intro wait for it wait for it wait for it after I think master yeah last day it's spelled right yeah I know we fixed that for the YouTube release just minor things and that weird interlacing issue we fixed that too I look so ridiculous in my my like grand theft auto intro screen thing yeah that stage was so cool I know it ended up looking so great in James's grandiose intro someone with a Chinese username says what's funny is people think they actually read this chat occasionally we do I don't know if they can actually hear this or no audio I haven't okay yeah that's no it's it's fine it's fine anyway it looks really good and yeah we're gonna have to figure out if we can get audio so thankfully check yeah thanks thanks guys oh man I hope people like it do we have any other main topics today or did it take us that oh wait I never did the madrenas talking

and I really really wanted the red one for this so I am not expecting these to last past about the first hour or two yeah now to be clear we don't normally sell that kind of volume of shirts but we also don't normally do limited edition shirts and when we do they tend to sell really well it's just it's kind of thing we try not to overdo like that Tech linked shirt with the tape I forget how many

Now, obviously, when you go to court, you have to wear a suit,\nbut I'm not always in court, as evidenced by this actual video, and when I'm not I love to wear things like what I'm wearing right now, which is a polo from Mack Weldon. It's hard to explain how\nsoft and light this polo is. I absolutely love it, and I'm thrilled that Mack Weldon is now a sponsor. I'm also wearing their world\nfamous boxer briefs right now, but I can't, obviously, show that to you. Well, unless, hold on. grunts and strains Ah, these are their famous boxer briefs, incredibly comfortable, super soft. I really like the pattern on them as well. Here's a picture of me wearing them. This is definitely me\nwearing them, obviously. I don't know why the camera\ncut my head off there. But, I've been thrilled\nwith the Mack Weldon shirts, shorts, and underwear\nthat I purchased from them, and I've been putting\nit through the ringer, including playing multiple hours of tennis in all of the clothing and\nit has held up beautifully, and has stayed unbelievably comfortable. Mack Weldon is a men's\nessential clothing brand that focuses on smart\ndesign and premium fabrics. The smart design goes beyond\njust the clothing itself, it goes into the website. When I had to order this\npolo with my own money, I had to get it shipped, expedited, to arrive here in time for VidCon, and the process was incredibly simple. I ordered multiple sizes,\nI had it shipped overnight, I tried on the clothes,\nI kept the ones that fit and I sent back the ones that didn't using the included return shipping label, and it was a wonderful experience. Mack Weldon says that their stuff is the most comfortable underwear, socks, and other clothing that\nyou will ever wear, and I think that is totally reasonable. So, if you would like 20%\noff your first purchase from Mack Weldon, just\ngo to MackWeldon.com or use the promo code\nleaglaeagle at checkout. Again, so, for 20% off\nof your first purchase from Mack Weldon, go to MackWeldon.com, and if you order a pair of\ntheir famous boxer briefs and you don't like it for any reason, you can keep it and they will still give you a refund without sending it back, "

405, 'there is still just a ticking clock and \na fetch-execute cycle. I’ve used a password manager for years, and if you’re techie enough to reach the\nend of this video, you should too. And I’m not just saying that because this video is\nsponsored by Dashlane, a password manager, and if you go to dashlane.com/tomscott, you can get\na free 30-day trial of their premium version. Why should you use Dashlane? Well, first,\nreusing passwords is a terrible idea. If you’re like me a few years back, then you’re reusing very similar passwords\nthat have a few letters changed, or have the site’s name stuck somewhere in them. It’s not great. One data breach at one of those sites, and it’d be time to start worrying. These days, Dashlane sits in my browser,\nand when I want to log in somewhere, I unlock Dashlane with the single\npassword that I have to remember, and it autofills it for me. Dashlane also stores and autofills credit cards and\naddress information across your devices, and it’s got a VPN to encrypt your traffic on public wifi networks if you want to. If you are the kind of person who can remember 20-character unique symbol-filled passwords\nfor dozens of different sites, congratulations. But if you’re not superhuman,\nthen your choice is basically: use insecure passwords or\nuse a password manager. Now, you could use post-it notes on your\nmonitor as a password manager… or you could use Dashlane, which generates, stores, and autofills\nlong, secure, different passwords for every site. I don’t have to try and type in a 20-character password filled with symbols on my phone any more. I pull up Dashlane instead. Everything just works, synchronised on all my devices, across Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android,\nall automatically. It plugs into Chrome, Firefox, Edge,\nSafari, Opera, even Internet Explorer. And despite the fact that it’s all\nsynchronised in the cloud, Dashlane themselves don’t know what\nthose passwords are and based on their security architecture,\ncan never find them out. I’ll explain that next time. So: dashlane.com/tomscott for a 30-day\nfree trial of Dashlane Premium, which includes unlimited password storage and sync. And if you like it, you can use the code\n“tomscott” for 10% off. '

Speaking of extreme ingenuity, the book I've\nbeen listening to this month is about the Wright brothers. Huge thanks to Audible for sponsoring this\nvideo. The Wright Brothers is quite possibly one\nof my favorite audio books of all time. It talks about how 2 guys were able to succeed\nin building the first ever flying machine using their own brains and their own money. What makes their invention even more impressive\nwas that at the same time the Wright brothers were working, the government was dropping\noodles of money into developing their own flying machine, which ended up failing miserably. The true story of the Wright brothers' hard\nwork and ingenuity paid off big time and I definitely recommend listening to it.

I know most people can’t find time to sit\ndown and read books, so rather, you can listen to this book when you’re driving, doing\ndishes, at work, going for a run, or whenever through Audible.

Exclusively in the month of July, Audible\nis offering Amazon Prime members their first three months of membership for 66% off by\ngoing to audible.com/HAI.

580, 'there is still just a ticking clock and \na fetch-execute cycle. I’ve used a password manager for years, and if you’re techie enough to reach the\nend of this video, you should too. And I’m not just saying that because this video is\nsponsored by Dashlane, a password manager, and if you go to dashlane.com/tomscott, you can get\na free 30-day trial of their premium version. Why should you use Dashlane? Well, first,\nreusing passwords is a terrible idea. If you’re like me a few years back, then you’re reusing very similar passwords\nthat have a few letters changed, or have the site’s name stuck somewhere in them. It’s not great. One data breach at one of those sites, and it’d be time to start worrying. These days, Dashlane sits in my browser,\nand when I want to log in somewhere, I unlock Dashlane with the single\npassword that I have to remember, and it autofills it for me. Dashlane also stores and autofills credit cards and\naddress information across your devices, and it’s got a VPN to encrypt your traffic on public wifi networks if you want to. If you are the kind of person who can remember 20-character unique symbol-filled passwords\nfor dozens of different sites, congratulations. But if you’re not superhuman,\nthen your choice is basically: use insecure passwords or\nuse a password manager. Now, you could use post-it notes on your\nmonitor as a password manager… or you could use Dashlane, which generates, stores, and autofills\nlong, secure, different passwords for every site. I don’t have to try and type in a 20-character password filled with symbols on my phone any more. I pull up Dashlane instead. Everything just works, synchronised on all my devices, across Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android,\nall automatically. It plugs into Chrome, Firefox, Edge,\nSafari, Opera, even Internet Explorer. And despite the fact that it’s all\nsynchronised in the cloud, Dashlane themselves don’t know what\nthose passwords are and based on their security architecture,\ncan never find them out. I’ll explain that next time. So: dashlane.com/tomscott for a 30-day\nfree trial of Dashlane Premium, which includes unlimited password storage and sync. And if you like it, you can use the code\n“tomscott” for 10% off. '

644, '[ad start]\nThis free video series about the basics of browser exploitation, is supported by SSD\nSecure Disclosure. If you find a critical vulnerability in a\npopular and widespread software or hardware, for example browsers, my recommendation would\nbe to first contact SSD. On their site ssd-disclosure.com you can also\nfind a list of targets they are generally interested in. So let’s say you have found a critical vulnerability\non one of those targets. Then you can send this vulnerability to SSD,\nthey will confirm and pay you for it, and start a responsible disclosure process where\nthey contact the vendor and the vulnerability is responsibly disclosed and published while\nyou still get the credit for it. Not every vendor offers bug bounties for researchers\nfor example Apple. Also, other exploit acquisition programs usually\ndo not disclose the vulnerabilities to vendors. So checkout their site and make sure to read\nmore about the scope and the submission process.

813, 'there is still just a ticking clock and \na fetch-execute cycle. I’ve used a password manager for years, and if you’re techie enough to reach the\nend of this video, you should too. And I’m not just saying that because this video is\nsponsored by Dashlane, a password manager, and if you go to dashlane.com/tomscott, you can get\na free 30-day trial of their premium version. Why should you use Dashlane? Well, first,\nreusing passwords is a terrible idea. If you’re like me a few years back, then you’re reusing very similar passwords\nthat have a few letters changed, or have the site’s name stuck somewhere in them. It’s not great. One data breach at one of those sites, and it’d be time to start worrying. These days, Dashlane sits in my browser,\nand when I want to log in somewhere, I unlock Dashlane with the single\npassword that I have to remember, and it autofills it for me. Dashlane also stores and autofills credit cards and\naddress information across your devices, and it’s got a VPN to encrypt your traffic on public wifi networks if you want to. If you are the kind of person who can remember 20-character unique symbol-filled passwords\nfor dozens of different sites, congratulations. But if you’re not superhuman,\nthen your choice is basically: use insecure passwords or\nuse a password manager. Now, you could use post-it notes on your\nmonitor as a password manager… or you could use Dashlane, which generates, stores, and autofills\nlong, secure, different passwords for every site. I don’t have to try and type in a 20-character password filled with symbols on my phone any more. I pull up Dashlane instead. Everything just works, synchronised on all my devices, across Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android,\nall automatically. It plugs into Chrome, Firefox, Edge,\nSafari, Opera, even Internet Explorer. And despite the fact that it’s all\nsynchronised in the cloud, Dashlane themselves don’t know what\nthose passwords are and based on their security architecture,\ncan never find them out. I’ll explain that next time. So: dashlane.com/tomscott for a 30-day\nfree trial of Dashlane Premium, which includes unlimited password storage and sync. And if you like it, you can use the code\n“tomscott” for 10% off. '

824, "- What? Today there is no witty\nremark, or pithy segway. When I cover stories like these, it makes me want to do as much good for as many people as possible. If this video leaves you wanting to do some good in this world, I'd recommend Tab for a Cause, which lets you raise money for charity just by opening up tabs,\nand browsing the Internet, which you were going to do anyway. Tab for a Cause is a\nGoogle Chrome Extension that allows you to pick\nthe charity of your choice, and then every time you open up a new tab, instead of there being a blank page, it displays a beautiful\nnew customizable tab with a couple of tiny ads. The money that you generate is\nthen donated to your charity. The gorgeous new tab is customizable. And my favorite option is\nthat it shows you how much you are generating for\neach specific charity. After you've opened up a tab, or two, you can then choose the actual charity you want the money to go to. It's like a game, except you are actually changing\nthe world that you live in. There's absolutely no charge to you, and it makes a positive\ndifference in this world. Tab for a Cause users like you have raised hundreds of thousands\nof dollars for charity. It is the easiest possible\nway to donate to charity, and make the world a better place. So just click the link in the description, and download the extension, "

I think the coolest thing about portal is the smart camera feature, which you see in action here So as I would move around my workshop and Ken moved around his the camera frames the video to keep us both centered and this Is great for us because we're not constantly moving the cameras around or tied to just working in one spot and smart sound enhances our voices as we move about so we Can still hear each other regardless of other shop noise [Diaphragm drop off] [Laugh] And of course when it comes to any device in a home, privacy is a big deal So with a single tap portal will allow you to disconnect both the camera and the microphone or if you prefer an analog solution They provide a camera cover Also, the smart camera uses AI technology that runs locally on portal not on some remote servers. At the end of the day, it's a great piece of hardware and it worked really well for us So if you want to learn more about Portal or maybe even get your own just go ahead and use the link in the video description.

Last time I went to China, I learned two things first the hearty pancake breakfast is poorly named and second I couldn't access Netflix or YouTube or any of the sites I normally go to unless I was using NordVPN, who also just happened to be supporting this video. If you travel internationally VPN is a must but it's also important at home too. As you know VPN stands for virtual private network. So you could surf the web anonymously, your location stays private, and all your data is encrypted. And even though I'm not a bad guy with something to hide, I generate a ton of data online every day, which I would prefer not to be used against me, like a lot of the news stories you hear lately. And as a bonus if you ever get a message about content not being available in your country, hypothetically, with just a click of a mouse your computer can teleport to anywhere in the world. It's me, Mario! And NordVPN is the best because it's super easy to set up and to use and super fast with thousands of servers across the globe. They also have Apple and Android apps for mobile browsing that are free with your account. So if you travel, or if you're just ready to start taking your privacy more seriously, you go to NordVPN.com/MarkRober or use the link of the video description for 77 percent off their three-year plan. Which works out to less than three bucks a month. So, it's NordVPN.com/MarkRober "

1084, 'Speak his name." Conclusion\nWell, if you\'re new to Pratchett, I hope that whets your appetite a bit. This is just the barest taste of what the\nman created. There\'s much, much more, and every moment\nof it is worthwhile. We\'ve still got a short story to write before\nwe wrap this series up, but there\'s actually an excellent way to fill the time while you\'re\nwaiting: you could settle in with a free Terry Pratchett audiobook, courtesy of Audible. They have a huge catalogue of books, including\nthe vast majority of Pratchett\'s works. If you want to meet some of the characters\non this list for the first time, Audible has you covered. To get started on the right foot reading the\nexpansive Discworld, I recommend Hogfather, which is all about Death, belief, and the\nhuman need for fantasy. Otherwise, if you want something that stands\nall on its own, I can make no better recommendation than the hilarious, masterful, irreverent\nGood Omens, written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman together. To get either of these audiobooks at no cost,\nall you have to do is sign up for a free 30-day trial with Audible by visiting audible.com/talefoundry,\nor by texting the code talefoundry to 500-500. Not only is it a free audiobook-it\'s also\na free way to support the show. '

That’s the power of a website like Brilliant.org,\nyou take control of your learning on topics like computer science, math, and physics. Behind all the technology in this video are\nsome really fascinating concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and computational\nlogic. All of which may sound intimidating, but are\nactually pretty fun and rewarding to learn with Brilliant. In too many of my classes, and probably yours\ntoo, we’re taught the steps to do a problem, but not really why, or how. That’s because we’re only memorizing one\nspecific problem, not actually understanding the process. The latter is what’s actually fun and useful\nin the real world. And that’s what you get with Brilliant - you\npractice the skills and see examples along the way. Here we’re learning about how computers\nstore information, There’s an explanation, a visual, and a\nchance to check our understanding. All very approachable. If we answer incorrectly, it shows us exactly\nhow to get the solution. It really is a fantastic way to learn, especially\nif you’re currently a student or just like learning new things.

But, let’s be honest, I usually ended the\nweek with more to do than when I started - it’s a lot easier to add to the list than remember\nto check it.

Let’s be real, we all have busy lives and\nit’s kinda hard to find an hour or two during the day where you can sit down and read. But it’s easy to put on an audiobook on\nthe way to work or school, or while doing chores, or writing long rambling YouTube comments. Not that you guys would do that… What I like about this book, in particular,\nis that it’s a nice, general overview of China, It doesn’t pretend to know the future,\nand it doesn’t have any kind of agenda, it’s a straightforward, objective explanation.

Dave, over on Here’s the Bad Version has\nan idea for a solution: An app. You’d scan your phone when you buy it, tell\nit how often you wanna upgrade, and then it sends you a notification when it’s the best\ntime to sell. I’m 100% serious when I say I think this\ncould be a multi-million dollar startup, someone just needs to program it. You could design the app to make predictions\nabout how the value of your phone might change in the future, for example, with the machine\nlearning course on Brilliant, which teaches you, step by step, intuitively, with its computer\nscience and math courses. Their Computer Science Algorithms course will\nteach you the concepts behind how you might design the app to scan the iPhone’s barcode\nand then generate an eBay listing when the user is ready. In my programming classes, I noticed that\nI learned a lot faster when I was actually making something versus when I was just studying\narbitrarily. Plus, it’s just more fun to make something.

1200, 'Yeah, this is something\nthat most people can do. I think it\'s really\npretty straightforward. So, I was just gonna leave this video here but chuckles I didn\'t\nfeel comfortable with that because I knew a bunch\nof you were gonna ask me, "Scotty, I just wanna replace my battery. "I don\'t wanna go on a crazy\nmarket AliExpress adventure. "What batteries should I buy? "Just tell me which one." And based on the work\nthat I\'ve done this far, I didn\'t feel like I had a\nbattery that I could point at and be like, "Buy this\none, it\'s the good one." And it was really bugging me. So, I talked to my\nfriends over at, iFixit. And I think we might\nhave an answer for you. Just in the interest of full transparency, they are sponsoring this\nvideo but they put together a battery kit which includes\nnot only just the battery, but also all the tools and\nsupplies you need to swap it out. I asked them to send\nover one of their kits because I didn\'t want to recommend it, unless I tested it out myself. And they sent it over\nsuper rush in time for me to finish this video. However, I didn\'t get this until I had to be out of the apartment. If you don\'t know what that\'s\nabout, watch the last video but, hence the different background. So, let\'s open this thing up. box ripping So, it\'s got tools. tools clattering laughs No, not strapped in. Awesome. So it has all the tools that you could possibly\nneed for this, very cool. And then screen gasket, battery strips. But the big question,\nis how is the battery? So it is an, iFixit branded battery, which is what we would expect. indistinct iPhone 7. It\'s got the right specs. Most importantly, let\'s\nput this on the tester. So, we see original one of one, iPhone 7. Cycle count, 0, kind of what we\'d expect. Full capacity, 2003, so slightly\nabove the design capacity, which gives it 102%. And let\'s see, let\'s test life here. 100, that\'s good. So, at least according to the tester, this is a pretty decent battery out of the ones we tested. iFixit did say they test\nall of the batteries at their headquarters on\ntest equipment like this. Now, this is an aftermarket battery. It wasn\'t made by Apple, similar to the Nohan and\nthe Doremi batteries. But iFixit claims that it\'s\nmade to the same quality that Apple makes their batteries. I\'ve also really enjoyed\nworking with them thus far, they\'re super nice people. They have incredible customer support. And I actually use their repair guides as my canonical reference whenever I do any of my iPhone projects. They\'ve also committed even though Apple has\nraised their price back up from $29 to $49, to replace a battery, that they\'ll keep their\nbattery kits at $29 or below until the end of this year, 2019. Now, that\'s no $5 battery from the Chinese cell phone markets but they\'re backing\nwith one year warranty, so I know if you have any problems, they\'ll do right by you. If you wanna order one\nof their battery kits or you just wanna use\ntheir free repair guides to swap out a battery\nyou got somewhere else, you can find links to both\nof those in the description. So what are you waiting for? Whether you buy one of the iFixit kits or whether you buy a battery online, or get it some other way, go\nreplace your iPhone battery.

1277, "Or is it? Right well, I'll talk about whether it's better or not in a moment. But first I should say something about my kind sponsors. Yes, the Great Courses Plus. The Great Courses Plus is a huge website. You can visit it and there you can see on it loads and loads of lecture courses. I found a very interesting one for instance that's on palaeontology. Now I have a degree in archaeology and a lot of people go: 'Oh wow, archaeology. I find that really interesting, so tell me about the stegosaurus then.' Ah, no, that's palaeontology. I did archaeology which is digging up the remains of the human past. But anyway, I suppose it's related and we all like dinosaurs, don't we? Only this course is a bit more serious. It's not all about you know the famous stuff like the brontosaurus and ... did the brontosaurus even exist? and the stegosaurus and the triceratops and the tyrannosaurus rex and all those ones. Instead, it's a bit more academic a bit more interesting I think for it in that it looks about how fossils are formed, how they are discovered and how they are interpreted and all that sort of thing. It goes through all the important ages, geological ages, many of which precede the tyrannosaurus rex by quite a lot of millions of years. Anyway, I'm going to be looking at that one. But you, of course, can pick from loads and loads of courses. And for one month you can do so absolutely for free if you type in this address, which is appearing on your screen now. www.TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/Lindybeige then that will take you to an offer. It's actually much easier by the way to click on the link which I'll put in the description so short click ... Short link and you just click on it and voom you're there. Much easier. And you will find that you can get one free month looking at any of the courses you care to have a look at. Typically there are about 24 lectures in a course, and each one is about half an hour long, so it's 12 hours per course of facts. And, if you don't like it, at the end of the month you can decide it's not for you, all you have to do is is cancel and then you won't owe a bean. So there you go. Why not go to the Great Courses Plus, give them a look and ... I hope you like it. Anyway back to muzzle brakes. Now, you may think: 'Oh well, muzzle brakes are great. They manage the smoke better, and they lower the recoil. "

1284, 'going to propose a solution to it in this video which has been sponsored by - Dollar Shave Club yes the Dollar Shave Club more of that later '
1285, "maybe maybe I can propose a solution to this problem and I will do so but once I have told you about my sponsor which is the Dollar Shave Club now the Dollar Shave Club is it's a service they they send you men's grooming products through the post and you get little parcels now I must admit that I have not been using a service like this possibly you can tell but I can say that my whole life I have used a not wildly dissimilar service which is that being British I am able to have milk fresh milk delivered to my door every day and do you know it's really nice you open the door and yeah there's your morning painter I guess someone's thinking of it now okay I know my true relationship with with my milkman which is not genetic it's a financial business relationship I understand that but even so it's nice someone has done that for me and I don't have to go out to the supermarket anything like as often as I otherwise would because milk is something you have to buy frequently and it's perishable and so forth so getting milk deliver this is nice and we like receiving stuff in the pinup in the poster now obviously if you don't like receiving parcels then a service like this is probably not for you but don't we like oh someone sent me a box of stuff and I'm not into the shorts in there it's a bit like opening a Christmas present or something there's a there's a little bit of excitement there so that's one of the reasons that you might want to use one of these services but the more perceptive of you and I would say the less perceptive of you and I would extend this to to those of middling perceptive abilities may all have drawn the same conclusion which is that I am not an obvious ambassador for a company that sells men's grooming products and I intimated this to them and they they persuaded me they said no you see you're a victim and that's what we need you're you're someone that life has just crushed and we could use you you you serve as a as a warning to the rest of humanity to the possibility of what you may end up like if you don't use our products and you serve as a sort of universal before picture doesn't matter what male grooming product we're trying to sell with you as the before picture you will serve I did actually see their point anyway so they've sent me a box and I'm contractually obliged to open it with you I've already slit the plastic bit so it comes open that's get rid of that and yes yes that's the smell I was expecting and I see I see a toothbrush which appears to be like a toothbrush and we need two brushes otherwise our teeth not always a clean and ah no this is ah yes they have favoured me cuz this this is no ordinary handle for a razor no no this I I see straightaway is the executive handle I'm not entirely sure what that means it doesn't have a smart suit on it's not carrying a briefcase and it's probably not going to give it give anyone in the orders but but it's an executive one which is got a bit of heft to it and some grippy rubber and yes and this must be yes these are the blades and this is called a cassette apparently you you get four months of them here oh and my goodness how many blades are we up to do you think it's actually so many they're difficult to count it's it's six we're up to six blades now so there you go for those of you who have used a smaller number of blades you may have found that sometimes your primary blade doesn't do the job in a bit of hair gets passed but then maybe your secondary blade gets it but sometimes it doesn't so then your tertiary blade comes into play but you know even the tertiary blades sometimes let you down so then of course on on other lesser razerheadz you've got your special contingency blade which comes into action but there's still not about 100 percent guaranteed to do the job so then comes the emergency backup blade well ladies and gentlemen I suppose mostly gentlemen although actually I'm told that only four million customers that Dollar Shave Club has had about twenty percent of them are women yes now if your first second third fourth and fifth blades all let you down the last resort blade on this will do the job probably what I don't know what the limits are I mean it's certain there are mostly limits of physics and engineering to the number of blades that they're actually practicable on ahead we're up to six now it seems maybe in years to come that people have just sort of a rack like a washboard do you some rub your face on it or something I don't know anyway seven tubes of stuff I have a tube of hydrating daily face cleanser which is citrus and Hawaiian ginger now hydrating is good of course because some people have a lot of trouble drinking water and so the only way they can get water into them is to rub it through their skin daily face cleanser I know what cleanser is that just means cleaner but it sounds better and date I don't actually have a daily face which is quite evident mine is weekly or even more of a monthly face but if you've got a daily face and it needs cleansing or cleaning presumably that'll do and an Hawaiian ginger is like ordinary ginger but with more vowels citrus doesn't say what sort of citrus mystery citrus oh nope it's great for chocolates my favorite and this one is okay I've read it three times now and I disappearing post-shave do our words that I've never seen in that order before disappearing it evaporates do that's that's water right post shape I understand what post shave is anyway it says for a light and soothing finish a lot well there you go so if you if you are someone who's in the habit of shaving and I imagine that most of my audience does not have beards then you may find that sometimes your your shave finish is too dark or too heavy in which case this will perhaps help here we have easy shave butter I'm a beginner to this sort of thing so I think it's appropriate they sent me the easy version I imagine that others of you will be able to order more advanced shave butter butter I've known again shave butter but anyway for us it's a for effortless delightful shaving delightful they go for some people I'm sure shaving is a hobby no delight so um that'll be good and I have the super bra no I have misread that it's super BA and oh it's toothpaste you know let's put the Handy size actually fit for travel in your Airport and so forth and it says peppermint kick so there you go superb ah for people with teeth that need a kick and here we have hydrating again which is which is good don't don't overdose on water kids hair and scalp shampoo which is sage and black pepper sage of black pepper as Moses huh I spot a masculine scent isn't it and I suppose in an emergency he could double his a cooking ingredient hair and scalp shampoo and is that is that different from normal shampoo have I been doing it wrong all these years is there such a thing as just scalp shampoo how do you use that without getting it on your hair that's be really tricky well just hair shampoo so you don't go all the way down to the scalp because then something will go horribly wrong I don't know but this one does hair and thank goodness scalp and then there's this which is a mandatory prep scrub so there you go this one's not optional it's it's mandatory and properly prepare for shave greatness it says okay I'll do that and here we have more hydrating my goodness I'm gonna be so hydrated it's coming just flowing out of me body cleanser which is calming amber and lavender calming amber calming amber is amber even a smell does amber smell or some other thing and while Brazil II there's they have quite a wide range of products presumably if you want their panic-inducing amber you can get that too so there you go now if you go to www.hsn.com or US dollars if you're American and some near equivalent if you're from one of the other countries that they serve which is Australia Britain and Canada but no British forces supposed to overseas yet I'm afraid sorry chaps but they're working on it anyway so you can there's an offer and yes in in time I will of course give this a go but not right now because if you don't mind I'm in the middle of a "

1309, 'MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight\'s\nepisode of Critical Role where a bunch of us nerdy ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &\nDragons. Before we dive into tonight\'s game, we got some announcements to get through. First and\nforemost, we have two fantastic sponsors tonight. The first of which is our good friend D&D Beyond!\nThey\'ve been with us since we began this campaign. The new book, Mordenkainen\'s Tome of Foes,\nreleases tomorrow. I got one last month and it\'s amazing. Oh my god, it\'s so good. It has the\nAstral Dreadnought, I\'m so happy. Hope you guys never have to fight one. You can order that now on\nD&D Beyond and check out the wonderful content there. If you order on D&D Beyond, you also\nreceive the Rrakkma Adventurers League gith-focused introductory adventure for free. If\nyou know what that means, we\'re of like mind. The githyanki is such an amazing part of D&D lore. LIAM: Go Yankees! MATT: Go Razi! Anyway, as a reminder, Tome of Foes\nis also available in D&D Beyond\'s legendary bundle, which is still 25% off using the code\n826LA. If you want it to do the legendary bundle, get the huge discount, Tome of Foes is included in\nthat, so go and check it out. It\'s amazing. Thank you, D&D Beyond, and hope you enjoy the new\nrelease tomorrow. Sam? You want to talk about our other sponsor for the evening? SAM: Yes, our second sponsor for the evening is\nBackblaze! cheering SAM: If you don\'t know Backblaze-- I\'m sorry. If\nyou guys don\'t know Backblaze, it is unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month.\nYes, Backblaze stores docs, music, photos, videos, fanart, and more. I use the service, and to be\nhonest, I always thought, "It sounds magical." Well guys, I\'ve discovered that it is actual\nmagic. Faery magic to be exact; In fact, I captured one of their head faeries, Yev, a little\nsprite named Yev, in this trash bag. TRAVIS: Look at him flittering around! SAM: Flits around a lot. He\'s just settling down\nin here. MARISHA: There is no air hole; that\'s so\nirresponsible. SAM: It\'s okay! Oh look! Magic is real! I have it\nright here in the bag! Yev, how does Backblaze work? TOY IN BAG: bird tweeting SAM: Oh! He says you can restore files anywhere\nvia direct download. LAURA: Did you think that was going to be loud\nenough? SAM: Shh. I\'ve got a backup if it doesn\'t work. He\nsays you can restore files anywhere via direct download, or restore by mail and receive a hard\ndrive with your files. Yes, Yev, but how does Backblaze keeps all those backups for such a low\nprice? TOY IN BAG: garbled speech imitation laughter SAM: Wait! Yev says that they harness the power of\nlove to store data and that love also sustains your life? Wait a second, without your love,\nyou\'ll die?! Oh my god! TOY IN BAG: squealing SAM: Oh god, everyone! Yev is sick! LAURA: No! SAM: Maybe the power of our applause will cure\nhim. Everyone clap. Oh my god no, it\'s made it worse! His lung has collapsed. He\'s bleeding\ninternally. Oh my god, what can we do?! He says that not enough people have visited\nbackblaze.com/criticalrole. TRAVIS: You\'re shaking it! SAM: That\'s him shaking, it\'s not me. My puppetry\nwork is amazing. TOY IN BAG: squealing SAM: Not enough people have visited\nbackblaze.com/criticalrole to sign up to get a 15-day free trial. Critters! If you want Yev to\nlive, you need to click on the site right now! Oh god! Oh god, he\'s flatlining. He\'s dead. LAURA: No! SAM: Yev is dead! The Backblaze faery is dead. TOY IN BAG: squealing SAM: Oh! What?! It\'s a miracle! LAURA: Don\'t clap! SAM: Enough critters visited\nbackblaze.com/criticalrole and signed up. You saved his life! We can continue the show. LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh my god. MATT: You are a master at building tension. SAM: Puppetry. That was a real faery, guys. LIAM: The Jim Henson studio was mad to let you\ngo. TRAVIS: How you ever snagged it with just a\nkitchen garbage bag is beyond me. MATT: He\'s thrifty. SAM: A child\'s lightsaber toy thing. MATT: Don\'t ruin the illusion! ASHLEY: What are you doing? MARISHA: Why do you show your tricks? ASHLEY: Yes, stop it! LAURA: That\'s so quiet. SAM: I know, it\'s too quiet. MATT: The faery escaped and left us presents. SAM: It\'s a dragon. Oh no, it ran out of\nbatteries! Everyone clap! Yeah, it\'s alive! TALIESIN: My face hurts. MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Backblaze,\nfor your amazing support.

As you can see here, it took me exactly one\nminute and seven seconds to go from walking in the door of Laguardia to getting into security. The X-ray was completely backed up with a\nfew people in wheelchairs when I went through but that's actually a good thing because what\nI am showing you here is the absolute worst case scenario—the slowest security with\nclear will be. I put my camera in my bag during the screening\nso the TSA agents wouldn't yell at me but the timer is still running.

Typically, I only ever listened to nonfiction audiobooks because I find it hard to follow along with the story if it's a piece of fiction intended with page but surprisingly I had no trouble listening to the narration by Peter Kenney and I think it's because he uses very distinct voices for each character so you're never confused about who's speaking.

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA. So, if you wanna find out about the information in your DNA, you can go to 23andme.com/veritasium. So I want to thank 23andMe for supporting Veritasium, and I want to thank you for watching. "

In the Paris capital they read an article about the status\nof disrepair of the Eiffel tower and how maintenance expenses would be too costly for local government.\nThat sparked the idea for Victor’s craziest scam: he would sell the Eiffel Tower.\nThe idea actually was not that crazy. The Tower had been erected in 1889 as a temporary\nstructure, to be taken down no later than 1909, and yet it was still standing. It was\neffectively expensive to maintain, and the public opinion was split about it, many considering\nit an eye sore. So how about the French Government decided\nto sell it as scrap metal? Lustig carefully prepared his con. He first\nforged a set of stationery for the Ministry in charge of posts and telegraph.\nThis was realistic, as the Tower was used '

There's a video on Smarter Every Day where I went to the lab\nand see them using a chip like this to do what's\ncalled genotype testing. They don't sequence your DNA, they do genotype testing, which is a way to look at different SNPs, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, to understand more about\nyour genetic sequence. It's like a very small\nfraction of your sequence. There's two ways you can use 23 and me. You can just do the ancestry part, which makes a great gift for\nsomebody that's interested in genealogy and stuff like that. Or you can do health and ancestry, which is what I choose to do because I get all kinds of information about my body. Just like back in the day, they were seeing the dawn\nof precision manufacturing.

Clearly he was a man with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Maybe he could have loaded up his computer, and logged on to Skillshare. An online learning community, with more than 19,000 classes in design, business, technology and more. Perhaps he was considering a side-career in fashion. But didn't know where to start. On Skillshare, he would've found courses on fashion design, and garment construction. Or if he wanted to learn app design, improve his photography, or just how to make a really good quesadilla, He would have found courses for all of these and more, on Skillshare. Skillshare gives you access to high-quality classes taught by genuine experts working in their field. I work heavily with animation, and I was genuinely blown away by the number of really useful courses available to me. Like this class, full of tips and tricks for creating vector art. Or this one, for creating character walk cycles. For an annual subscription, Skillshare is under $10 a month. And if you'd like to try it out first, then I've got a deal just for OverSimplified viewers.

A few weeks ago, my Spotify account was hacked, exposing someone out there to all of my awesome\nplaylists. This was one of the few remaining accounts\nI had created with my “lazy” password, and a breach on another site meant that suddenly\nseveral of my accounts were vulnerable. This underscores why it’s so important to\nuse a password manager like Dashlane. Dashlane generates secure passwords for you, and can fill them in automatically on websites\nand apps so you don’t have to worry about remembering\neach one. This frees you up to create a unique password\nfor each account, so if one site gets breached it doesn’t\nmean that all your passwords are now vulnerable. I really can’t stress enough how important\nthis is, and how useful it is to have a password manager\nlike Dashlane. And what’s great is that you can create\nan account with Dashlane for free, so there’s really no excuse not to.

Many of my friends have recommended that I try it because they say its top notch. So I got them to agree to sponsor Smarter Every Day based on how many people sign up for a one month free trial. It's pretty simple. The more people that try it with me, the more support Smarter Every Day gets. You can do as many courses as you want for free, for an entire month. The thing I'm really excited about is you can link it up to your Apple TV and watch it on the big screen. There's an app, and you can check out all these courses. You'll wanna learn about paleontology, you can do that. I'm excited about Greek and Roman technology. My wife saw this. Pediatric medicine. This is not like a surface-level youtube knowledge.

1782, 'this video was sponsored by Nord VPN a virtual private network service that provides much-needed security in an age where cyber security is more important '
1783, ''
1784, 'So I boo-- coughs Sorry, so I teamed up with\nNordVPN in search of answers. See, in addition to the normal\nbenefits of using a VPN, anonymous web surfing,\nkeeping your location private, NordVPN offers another crucial feature, the ability to connect to the internet through any of their 5000-plus servers located all over the world. NordVPN has servers in over 60 countries, and, crucially, one of those countries is a little island nation known as Japan. Now what this means is that at any time, you can open up NordVPN\nand in a matter of seconds, virtually transport\nyour computer to Japan, saving you thousands of\ndollars on plane tickets. And here\'s the really magical part. By combining NordVPN with\nyour existing Netflix account, the one you probably already have, you can trick Netflix into letting you watch shows from other regions, including this entire\nseason of Terrace House. All without having to jump\nthrough any additional hoops. It is a shockingly painless process, and if you wanna try it for yourself, just go to nordVPN.org/terrace, or click the link in the description to get 75% off of their three-year plan, and use the coupon code "terrace" to get one full month free. Now, while researching this video, I actually stumbled across\nNordVPN organically, after seeing them\nrecommended over and over by users of the Terrace House sub-reddit, who all found themselves in the same predicament I did, many of whom had actually tried other VPNs to watch Terrace House and had issues with them\nbefore settling on this one. And I can only speak\nto my experience here, but in my experience it has been, actually, totally painless to do this. I\'m not exaggerating when I say the entire setup process for this, from installing the software to connecting to a Japanese server took me, like, 35 seconds, and NordVPN\'s servers are actually so fast that there have been multiple times while working on this video where I realized I was connected to the Japan server without even\nrealizing the VPN was on. And the best part is, it is\ntotally risk-free to try, so if somehow this doesn\'t work for you, NordVPN offers a full\n30-day money-back guarantee. So if you\'d like to try this out yourself and support my YouTube\nchannel in the process, you can head to nordVPN.org/terrace, that\'s nordVPN.org, not .com, /terrace for 75% off a three-year\nplan for 2.99 a month, and one month free. '
1785, 'and right now the only way you\'ll be able to watch along with us is by using a service like NordVPN. Again, nordvpn.org/terrace,\ncoupon code "terrace". '
